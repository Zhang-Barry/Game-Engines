The cool thing that I implemented in my project was the a sprite that allowed the player
to speed up and get the mario speed up sound effect for 10 seconds. I figured that a racetrack
with the player being at a singular max speed was boring, so I figured that the player should
be able to speed up through getting the speed up sprite.
